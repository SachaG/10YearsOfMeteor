*Note: I am not affiliated, nor have I ever been in the past, with Meteor, Apollo, or Tiny. These are my own personal thoughts. *

If you got into web development in the past couple years you might easily have never heard about [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). 

But when it first came out in 2012 (before React or Vue even existed!) it was the hottest thing around for a while. Not only that, to this day Meteor still does many incredible things that the rest of the ecosystem has never caught up with. 

And what's more, even if you've never used Meteor I'm willing to bet you've used software that came out of it, one way or another. So read on to learn more about Meteor's early rise, why it maybe burned too bright, and the lasting impact it had on modern JavaScript development. 

## 2012

Take yourself back to 2012. It's the aftermath of the financial crisis, but Barack Obama is president of the U.S. and assuring the world that there's hope. "Call Me Maybe" is topping the charts. And tech founders are to be admired and not yet [made fun of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)), much less feared for their oversize influence.

Deep in Silicon Valley, a team of brilliant engineers currently enrolled in [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) has a realization: building web apps is too damn hard! 

Our of this realization is born Meteor: a unified architecture on top of Node.js that bundles client, server, and database all in one neat little package that you can run (or even deploy for free!) with a single command. 

What's more, it was all reactive and in real-time! Can you imagine never having to write a `fetch()` or worrying about updating your client data cache? And all that using the same familiar MongoDB API syntax both on the server and client! 

Yep, it turns out Meteor was already tackling a huge chunk of the problems of modern web development in 2012. 

## A Lone Pixel Pusher

Believe it or not, way back in the early '10s I was earning a living [tweaking drop shadows in Photoshop](http://work.sachagreif.com/). As strange as it seems today, this was the tool of choice when it came to designing websites. This being the heyday of iPhone-inspired skeuomorphism, your paycheck depended on your ability to simulate a realistic leather texture for that button. 

Like many other UI designers though, I felt disillusioned that my beautiful creations didn't always survive the rocky transition from Photoshop to browser intact. This, along with an unhealthy dose of Silicon Valley kool-aid (I had just been to the Valley for the first time in the summer of 2011, and it made a huge impression on me), is mostly what pushed me to try and strike it rich on my own rather than keep playing second fiddle to unappreciative developers. 

I wasn't starting from zero either: long before pushing pixels I had obtained my computer science diploma, even if I wasn't quite top of my class. For example, I was once suspected of plagiarism because I was incapable of explaining what my own code did (my defense: if I was going to copy somebody else's code, I would've copied something that works!). But web development had to be easier than C and Java, right?

I went through Michael Hartl's [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/) but got overwhelmed with too many new concepts at once: routes, models, controllers, views, authâ€¦ All this combined with having to learn a new language meant Rails never quite clicked for me. 

On the other hand, something that *did* click was jQuery. It was JavaScript, which was a "normal-looking" programming language compared to Ruby, but with all the weird `DoSomethingWithTheDOM()` parts massaged into a sensible API. 

The first project I build with jQuery was a little tool called [Patternify](http://www.patternify.com/), which still exists to this day! I had a ton of fun, but at some point I started being frustrated once more: playing around in the browser was fine, but to achieve anything *big* you needed to involve a server and a database at some point. 

So here I was, a designer-slash-front-end-developer who loved JavaScript but was deathly afraid of servers. In other words, the perfect audience for Meteor. 

## Discovering Meteor

Meteor made a big splash right from the get-go, with one of the biggest [Hacker News launches](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3824908) of all time. As one commenter put it:

> My first impression of this: wow. If Meteor is all it appears to be, this is nothing short of revolutionary.

And revolutionary it was. Once my friend [Sean Grove](https://twitter.com/sgrove) pointed me to it (he was in the same YCombinator batch as the Meteor guys), Meteor immediately appealed to me. 

At the time, I was trying to build a "Hacker News for designers", something that for whatever reason nobody has ever quite succeeded in doing. With its real-time capabilities, Meteor seemed like the perfect for this kind of web app. I got to work, deciding to make the project open-source in the hopes of attracting <strikethrough>unpaid labor</strikethrough> like-minded contributors, and [Telescope](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/02/build-your-own-product-hunt-with-telescope-and-meteor/)
 was born. 
 
Throughout this whole process I got to know the other members of the budding Meteor community, one of which was [Tom Coleman](https://twitter.com/tmeasday), creator of Meteor's first package manager (Meteor launched without any kind of first-party package manager and only supported regular npm packages much later, which seems hard to imagine today).

I was fresh off writing a [somewhat successful design e-book](https://v3.sachagreif.com/ebook/) so I approached Tom with a proposal: we'd combine his deep knowledge of Meteor and my design and marketing skills to write a Meteor tutorial book and establish ourselves as the de facto way to learn the framework just as it was taking off. 

And guess what: *we did exactly that!* [Discover Meteor](http://www.discovermeteor.com/) launched in 2013 and thanks in no small part to a big boost from the Meteor team quickly became one of the main resources to learn Meteor, just as we had hoped. The book quickly became a big part of both our lives, and was also a big financial success (you can read this [Gumroad case study](http://gumroad.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/DiscoverMeteorCaseStudy.pdf) to learn more. 

We even had a [podcast](http://www.discovermeteor.com/podcast) and a [t-shirt](http://www.discovermeteor.com/tshirt), and I'm not sure how many other programming books can say the same. And did I mention *Discover Meteor* was also translated into dozens of other languages by volunteers (we made all the translations freely available)?

## Things Cool Down

At first, it seemed like everything was great in Meteor land. Tom eventually went to work for the Meteor Development Group (the company behind Meteor, also known as MDG) itself, the Meteor community was growing, and the book was doing great. 

But as the rest of the JavaScript ecosystem kept evolving (this is around the time React was gaining traction), many voices inside the Meteor community started questioning Meteor's idiosyncratic approach. 

It soon became clear that the community was splitting into two camps: those who appreciated Meteor's clear value proposition of simplifying web development by providing an all-in-one environment, and those who wanted more openness towards the npm ecosystem to avoid being left behind by the rest of the webdev community. 

Here's the catch: the contents of the book clearly targeted the first camp, but we as programmers were firmly in the second. Were we supposed to keep advocating for practices we didn't follow ourselves? Or should we rewrite the book from scratch to match what we actually did, in the process risking killing the very simplicity that made the book appealing in the first place?

We could never decide, and *Discover Meteor* slowly got out of date. And once Tom left the Meteor Development Group and stopped using Meteor altogether, it was clear that our adventure had come to an end. 

## Burning Out

Tom wasn't the only one who wanted to explore new skies. MDG itself had ventured into the GraphQL space, and soon pivoted to become [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), the company responsible for Apollo Client and Apollo Server among many other key building blocks of the GraphQL ecosystem. 

So what went wrong? I'm not privy to any inside information so this is just speculation on my part, but I think the team realized that the amount of work required to make Meteor work on a large enough scale to repay their investors was just too much. As it existed, Meteor could work as a niche tool for a specific kind of project, but it could never establish itself as a dominant force in enterprise software, which is where all the real money is. 

Achieving this would not only have required years of additional effort, but also throwing away most of the past five years of work, alienating their current community in the process. So just like there was never a newer, better *Discover Meteor 2.0*, MDG also never launched a Meteor 2.0 to address its current flaws and instead wisely chose to focus on Apollo and move on. 

## From Telescope to Vulcan

But while others had moved on, I on the other hand wasn't out of Meteor land by any means. 

Right from the start, my goal had been to find a framework that would let me launch web apps quickly and easily with JavaScript (the famed "Rails for JavaScript", if you will), and although Meteor came close, it wasn't quite there yet. Things like forms, models, internationalization, permissions, etc. were all missing, and I'd had to handle them myself for Telescope. 

But what's interesting is that although I had intended for Telescope to be a Hacker News clone, people had started using it for all kinds of different community-based apps, tweaking the templates to match their use case. This was such a cool direction that I decided to pivot the project to become a full-fledged general purpose web framework, and thus [Vulcan.js](http://vulcanjs.org/) was born. 

Vulcan's whole *raison d'Ãªtre* was to combine Meteor's simplicity with the modern React/GraphQL ecosystem, and throw in all the missing stuff (forms, etc.) in the process. And it was *itself* built on top of Meteor (even though it mostly used it as a build tool). What could go wrong?

Looking back, building Vulcan on top of Meteor instead of starting from scratch was not a good idea to say the least. I was hamstrung by all the same issues that Meteor was plagued with, without any of Meteor's advantages since I had eschewed the traditional Meteor building blocks in favor of React & co. 

I had made the bet that the current Meteor community would see Vulcan as its escape raft towards the larger JavaScript ecosystem, a way to port their pure-Meteor apps to a hybrid Meteor-and-React model. But by then, the people who wanted to abandon Meteor had already long done so, and the remaining community of die-hards used Meteor because they actually liked it.

Then again, there was no way I could've built something like Vulcan from scratch without standing on Meteor's shoulders, so maybe it had to be this way? And despite its relative obscurity, Vulcan has been used by others to [build startups](https://letter.so/), was used at a time by popular community [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/), and has been used by myself to build multiple sites (including, until recently, an apartment rental platform for my day job here in Japan). 

But more on Vulcan in a bit. 

## Meteor Today

In 2019, [MDG sold Meteor to Tiny](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/tiny-acquires-meteor/), a Canadian company that also owns [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/), [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/), and [many other companies](https://www.tiny.com/companies) you probably know. 

This marked a turning point for the framework: rather than try to conquer the world, Meteor would now focus on pleasing its existing community and growing at its own pace. This leaves us with a paradox: technically speaking, Meteor is the best and most stable it's ever been; yet there is virtually no interest in learning it from people who aren't already using it. 

And maybe that's fine. After all, as the creator of a very-niche-but-beloved framework myself, I'm in no position to be casting any stones. 

Stillâ€¦ I can't help but think about what could have been. What if Meteor *had* taken over the world like we all hoped it would? What if the problems that still plague web development to this day (state management, reactivity, data fetching) had been dealt with once and for all a decade ago?

## The Meteor Legacy

At this point you might be forgiven for thinking that Meteor burned too bright and fizzled out in the night sky without leaving a trace. But you'd be mistaken. Meteor did make a lasting impact, in more ways than one. 

One of the new front-end frameworks that quickly outgrew Meteor's own popularity was [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), created by Evan You. And where did Evan work at before creating Vue? You guessed it, MDG. 

Or, you might've heard of a tool named [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). It was created by [Arunoda Susiripala](Arunoda Susiripala), who was by far the most active open-source Meteor contributor (in fact a running joke was to talk about "the Arunodas", plural, because his output was too much to be the work of a single individual).

Today, Storybook is maintained by a company called [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/), which was co-founded by a certain Tom Coleman. Remember him?

And like I mentioned previously, the original Meteor team itself went on to create [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/).

And well, I guess there's also me. Back in 2016 I launched the annual [State of JavaScript](https://stateofjs.com/) developer survey. It's no Vue or Storybook, but it did establish itself over the years as one of the largest independent developer surveys around, and went on to spawn the [State of CSS](https://stateofcss.com/) and [State of GraphQL](https://stateofgraphql.com/) surveys. And the whole reason why I launched this survey in the first place was because I was so confused by the JavaScript ecosystem at large, after being coddled by Meteor's walled garden for so long!

## A New Direction for Web Apps

As I reflect on Meteor, an old debate has come back from the grave to once more rock the web development web: [SPAs vs MPAs](https://nolanlawson.com/2022/05/21/the-balance-has-shifted-away-from-spas/).

Single-Page Applications are apps that load all their JavaScript with one request, and then function more or less as a self-contained little piece of software from then on. On the other hand, Multi-Page Applications make back-and-forth requests to the server every time you navigate to a new page, thus their name. SPAs tend to have much of their logic run on the client (and also on the server for that first load, if server-side rendering (SSR) is supported), while MPAs have much lighter clients that are less resource-hungry. 

While I've always been bothered by the downsides of SPAs, I always thought the gap would be bridged sooner or later, and that performance concerns would eventually vanish thanks to things like code splitting, tree shaking, or SSR. But ten years later, many of these issues remain. Many SPA bundles are still bloated with too many dependencies, hydration is still slow, and content is still duplicated in memory on the client even if it already lives in the DOM. 

Yet something might be changing: for whatever reason, it feels like people are finally starting to take note and ask why things have to be this way. [Remix](https://remix.run/) has taken the React community by storm by offering a back-to-basic, performance-first approach, while Next.js is advancing its own solution in the form of [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/react-18/server-components). 

Even tools that are more on the static side of things are evolving, with a new crop of options like [Astro](https://astro.build/) or [Slinkity](https://slinkity.dev/) letting you control which components to hydrate or not. 

To say nothing of up-and-coming front-end frameworks like [Marko](https://markojs.com/), [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/), and [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/), which are all about giving you better control over rendering and being more efficient. While over in [Deno](https://deno.land/) land, [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) also embraces so-called "island architecture". 


## Ten Years

A lot has changed in 10 years: we've seen dicators and other assorted demagogues win elections throughout the world, the U.K. left Europe for no apparent reason, the pandemic tore down the nice fiction that we all come together in times of crisis, China took a hard turn towards even more totalitarianism, and now the war in Ukraine threathens to hurt the food supply of many of the world's poorer countries, to say nothing of the Putin-led genocide that has already torn apart the lives of so many Ukrainians. 

Oh and did I mention the world's unconscionable inaction in the face global warming, condemning us at best to a looming migration crisis on an unprecedented level, and at worst toâ€¦ well, the worst? 

Sorry to bring the mood down like that, but I do have a point. Which is that just maybe, on some level, this whole end-of-the-world thing is why Meteor's all-JavaScript, all-real-time, all-the-time approach seems a bit wasteful and excessive in today's context. 

Maybe we're also more conscious of less privileged segments of the population today who might not have access to the fastest mobile connection â€“ as well as the fact that *we*'re just one hurricane, wildfire, or dicator away from being less privileged ourselves. 

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed pushing the boundaries of the browser and redefining what a web app could be as much as anybody else. But as we enter [JavaScript's third age](https://www.swyx.io/js-third-age/), maybe it's time to slow down and build web apps in a more efficient and sustainable manner. 

I can only hope that in the process we manage to preserve just a tiny bit of that original Meteor magic and simplicity. Even after all this time, nothing has really come close.
